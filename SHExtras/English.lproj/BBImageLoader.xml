		<string>Unsafe Image Loader Patch</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>This patch downloads an image, cheerfully ignoring any security restrictions that QuickTime might impose.
		The URL must use one of the allowed protocols: file, http, https or ftp. Most common image file formats are supported: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, BMP, TGA, OpenEXR, JPEG 2000, PDF... When the download is finished, the "Done Signal" output is temporarily set to True and the image is made available on the "Image" output.

The downloaded images are kept in a shared cache, unless that option is specifically disabled in the patch's settings. The cache has a maximum allowed size of 10% of the total video memory. If the cache has reached its maximum size, older images are removed.</string>
