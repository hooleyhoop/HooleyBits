This file belongs to the "SampleOsax" sample that is a part of the "SampleProjects" package. Note that the "SampleProjects" folder contains a ReadMe file that describes the whole "SampleProjects" package.
"SampleOsax" demonstrates how to make a computational scripting addition (or 'osax') that you can later control or use from SmileLab - or from any AppleScript script.
The following lines are an AppleScript script that tests the sample osax. "SampleOsax script" must run in Smile and requires the SmileLab license. "SampleOsax script" use the SampleOsax to compute a fractal set and displays it in a graphic window where you can zoom in.
SmileLab documentation can be found at <www.satimage-software.com>.

Once built you must copy the osax into some /Library/ScriptingAdditions/ folder (preferably, user or local). Then you can execute "SampleOsax script": select the whole text then press the 'Enter' key (NOT Carriage Return).
For debug purpose, see the last commentary part of the following lines.
