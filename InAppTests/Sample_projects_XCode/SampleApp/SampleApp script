The "SampleProjects" folder contains a "Read me" file that describes the whole "SampleProjects" package."SampleApp" demonstrates how to make an existing computational code into a scriptable application so that you can control it, and so that it can interact automatically with SmileLab.The following lines are an AppleScript script that tests the sample application. "SampleApp script" must run in Smile and requires the SmileLab license. "SampleApp script" interacts with SampleApp in order to display the evolution of the temperature field with time.SmileLab documentation can be found at <www.satimage-software.com>.Launch the "HeatEquation" application (SampleApp/build/HeatEquation), select the following text then press the 'Enter' key (NOT Carriage Return).*)--initialize the matrix m (initial temperature field)set {n1, n2} to {30, 30}set x to creatematrix "x" ncols n1 nrows n2 range {0, 1}set y to creatematrix "y" ncols n1 nrows n2 range {0, 1}set md to evalformula "((x>0.7)&& (y>0.7))+((x<0.3)&& (y<0.3))-((x>0.7)&& (y<0.3))-((x<0.3)&& (y>0.7))" with {x:x, y:y}set m to {ncols:n1, nrows:n2, array of real:md}--set the initial temperaturetell application "HeatEquation"	set temperature to mend tell--draw the initial temperatureset theMap to QuickScalarMap({}, {}, m, 0)set limits of theMap to {-1, 1}set frame kind of container of theMap to 15set name of container of theMap to "HeatEquation"repeat 50 times	--tell "HeatEquation" to compute 100 steps, then display the current temperature field	tell application "HeatEquation"		compute 100		set mm to get temperature of it	end tell	smilepause 0.01	set data of theMap to mm	draw window of theMapend repeatdd("The end")
